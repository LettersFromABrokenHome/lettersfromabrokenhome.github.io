        >I'll give you another example. A few days after that dream, I prayed again to God asking Him to show me what to
        do. I listened to what He told me. I had another dream in which I was programming. I ran my code and it didn't
        work. But adamant there was nothing wrong with it, I ran it again. This time it worked. It fixed itself by me
        doing nothing. So I did precisely that. The problem solved itself.&nbsp;</span

        stop the beast? Because He wants to test us. To see our faith. He wants to see our flower blossom in harsh
        conditions.</span
