        >There's a belief out there called the invisible string theory. It says that everyone out there has a soul mate,
        a twin flame, someone for them chosen by the stars. And the invisible string theory says that these two people
        have a string tied around their fingers that they cannot see. The string bends, twists, but cannot break. And
        every day it shortens. Slowly bringing the twin flames together. You may be closer to your fame than you think.
        An integral part of this belief is you don't know who your other half is. You have to find out for yourself. And
        since you're never told, the only way to find the other end of the string is through trial and
        error.&nbsp;</span

        >That's one thing Hasbro got right. Life is a game. But it's like no game you've played before. It's got no
        instruction manual in its case. No tutorial level when you begin. And there's no walk-throughs online, because
        nobody has ever beaten the game before. Yes, trillions of people have made it through life, but your game is
        different than your parents'. No game is the same, so no walk-through for your play-through can exist. You're on
        your own playing through each level. The puzzle game, that is life, has infinitely many solutions for each
        chamber. And everyone going through finds their own path. Your pass through a stage is most certainly different
        than your buddie's. And that's okay, because if we all beat the game the same way it wouldn't be fun or
        entertaining.</span

        play the game, your way. Through trial and error you find a solution for each level until you meet The Boss. The
        Boss, who curated the game, judges your play-through. Then says "Game Over". You should never concede early.
