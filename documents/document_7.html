        impact on our lives. A game that brought me a new interest into gaming, and led to a spark of my career path. A
        game of which many of us can only smile back upon fondly. A game which is a shell of its former self. A
        corporate mess that eradicated the indie love it's skeleton team gave it.</span

        The pains and toils of your labor. Your old habits often seen as bad now by the community, that you cannot shake
        because you hold hard onto the old days. The days which escaped in a blink, and escaped your clasp. Forgotten
        hours when you had not a care in the world. Memories that fade like old photographs. Hours you sure cannot
        remember what you did, but hours you remember brought you joy and made you smile.</span

        the game became mocked and ridiculed. People would be harassed for playing the game and not the latest shooter.
